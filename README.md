# NamespaceStatsPlugin
Plugin for work (open source)

This repository contains a zip file, with all the contents of the Java project (src, metadata, etc), as well as a folder with just the src to view individually.

The basis of this project was to create a plugin to increase the functionality of software (created & used by Apelon, internally and by clients). This plugin creates statistics of medical namespaces, such as the count of concepts, terms, synonyms, etc.
